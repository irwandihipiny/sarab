### ABOUT US
Sarawak Biometrics Group, SARAB, of Universiti Malaysia Sarawak exists to undertake innovative, collaborative and interdisciplinary research resulting in world leading technology in the areas of biometrics and computer vision. SARAB was formed in 2016, consisting of members from multi-disciplinary backgrounds. The group offers shared and complementary strengths and aims to be the leading and authoritative body on research for biometrics (**sarab**) and computer vision (**sarab-cv**) in Malaysia.

**MSCs and PhDs positions are available**. Please contact us for further informations.
